                    <h2>main technologies</h2>
                    <h3><u>HTML</u></h3>
                    <img src="./images/html.png" alt="html" class="img-fluid">
                    <P><b>HTML</b> is the first layer of any website and creates the code version of a wireframe on a
                        webpage.
                        These wireframes exist for the styles in CSS and all the bells and whistles in JavaScript.
                        <br><br>
                        The letters in HTML stand for Hypertext Markup Language. The markup piece of the name is the
                        most important to remember, as markups are the proper name for HTML elements, which are also
                        called HTML tags. HTML as a whole is the markup that creates the basic elements we view on a
                        website. <br><br>However, it’s important to remember that HTML isn’t particularly intelligent.
                        It
                        doesn’t make
                        decisions or capture information on its own. It simply renders the scaffolding of the web pages.
                    </P>
                    <h3><u>CSS</u></h3>
                    <img src="./images/css.png" alt="css" class="img-fluid">
                    <P>Cascading Style Sheets, or <b>CSS</b>, is what gives our HTML visual appeal and draws in the
                        user. To
                        put it simply, style sheets dictate the presentation of HTML elements on a page. <br><br>CSS is
                        what makes everything not look like a white background with a bunch of Times New Roman
                        texts and blue hyperlinks. Have you ever tried to load Amazon on a bad day and see nothing but a
                        white page with a huge list of black texts, some blue links and nothing else? That’s Amazon
                        loading without styles. Styles are what transition beautiful designs onto a site. <br><br>A new
                        trend with styling is to use what is called a CSS pre-processor. These include Less, Sass
                        and stylists. Pre-processors are scripting languages that compile to CSS for the browser and are
                        very popular as they expedite the development process. They accommodate some programming logic.
                        <br><br>CSS pre-processors consolidate styling through “usability” and scale easily for use with
                        large
                        websites. Most front-end engineers of all levels have experience with pre-processors due to
                        their power and flexibility to suit all scenarios, from building small single-page websites to
                        enterprise applications such as Groupon or NBCUniversal.
                    </P>
                    <h3><u>JAVA SCRIPT</u></h3>
                    <img src="./images/js.png" alt="java script" class="img-fluid">
                    <P><b>JavaScript</b> is a runtime language for web browsers. This means that when you open a web
                        page, the
                        page will load both the foundational JavaScript that is standard with the page and any new
                        JavaScript added to a page. The new JavaScript will load in parallel with it and can perform
                        actions and make decisions. <br><br>JavaScript differentiates from back-end languages such as
                        Java or Ruby in that it’s visible to
                        the user and is not compiled ahead of time to run secretly behind the curtain. It’s the true
                        programming language of front-end engineering and the underlying language that ties everything
                        together. <br><br>A great example of JavaScript in action is OpenTable. Once we decide, “I want
                        a table for two at
                        7 P.M. in Seattle on July 25th,” a list of restaurants with tables to reserve shows up. From
                        here, we can look at a map with a list alongside it.

                    </P>
                    <h2>OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
                    <h3><u>React</u></h3>
                    <P>React is a library built on top of JavaScript. This means that it provides new syntax but it
                        still has good old JavaScript under the hood. By its declarative and component-based nature,
                        React makes creating web pages and web applications much faster and easier.It was created by
                        Facebook. Initially, it was supposed to be their internal tool helping the frontend developers
                        to build fast and easily-scalable interfaces, but the company decided to publish it as an
                        open-source project. At the moment, React is one of the most popular JS tools with a huge
                        community of programmers.
                    </P>
                    <h3><u>Angular</u></h3>
                    <P>Angular is a full-fledged JavaScript-based frontend framework supported by Google. The modularity
                        and component-based approach it provides has gathered a strong community among frontend
                        developers across the whole world. Some developers say that it’s a bit harder to learn Angular
                        than React but it’s definitely worth it as there is a high demand on the market for experts in
                        this technology
                    </P>
                    <h3><u>Vue</u></h3>
                    <P>Vue is a JavaScript framework responsible for creating user interfaces. It’s also based on
                        JavaScript and provides a declarative and component-based programming experience (similar to
                        React). It competes with Angular and React to rule the market. As proof of Vue’s popularity,
                        it’s worth mentioning that it has millions of weekly downloads on npm
                    </P>
